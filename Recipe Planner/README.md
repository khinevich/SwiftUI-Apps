### Problem Statement

Many people struggle to plan their daily meals in their stressful everyday lives.
I often ask myself what I should cook for dinner just before I have to start.

I need an application to store my recipes and assign them to a daily plan. The recipes should contain a list of ingredients, cooking instructions, and images.
Assigning tags to the recipes would help me organize my recipes.

To keep track of my health, the plan view should include a health score for every day that lets me quickly see the nutrition details of the planned meals.
The score should be calculated based on calorie reference values based on the age and weight entered by the user.
Additionally, information on protein, carbohydrates, and fat nutrition should be considered.

The application should allow the manual import of recipes via a form or the searching of online recipes and importing to the collection.

### Requirements

## Local development
Use XcodeGen to manage your Xcode Project. 

**What is XcodeGen?** XcodeGen is a tool that automatically generates Xcode project files from a simple configuration file. Instead of manually managing complex Xcode project settings, you define your project structure in the provided `project.yml` file, and XcodeGen creates the `.xcodeproj` file for you. This makes it easier to manage your Xcode project under version control (git), and resolve any merge conflicts that arise.

**Why do we need this?** When you clone this repository, you won't find a ready-to-use `.xcodeproj` file, which you can directly open with Xcode. Instead, you'll find a `project.yml` configuration file that describes how the Xcode project should be set up. You need to generate the actual Xcode project file before you can open and work on the app in Xcode.

1. Install xcodegen
    ```bash
    brew install xcodegen
    ```
2. Generate .xcodeproj
    ```bash
    xcodegen generate
    ```
    
    After running this command, you'll see a new `.xcodeproj` file appear in your project folder. You can then double-click this file to open your project in Xcode.

Since the `xcodegen generate` command must be run when the project is cloned and whenever changes affect the project structure, you can enable Git hooks to run the command automatically after merges and pulls.

Run the following command to point `git` to the hooks:
```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
